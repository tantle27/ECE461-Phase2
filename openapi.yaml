    API for ECE 461/Fall 2025/Project Phase 2: A Trustworthy Model Registry"

    All endpoints have BASELINE or NON-BASELINE listed. Please read through all descriptions before raising questions.

    An `artifact_id` is a unique identifier for each model/dataset/code entry. (Key idea -> the id is unique for all entities, even when a source reuses the same name).

    Hugging Face models rarely expose formal revision tags, so treat every ingest as a standalone artifact identified solely by its name and generated id.

    Eg.

        model_name: audience-classifier -> artifact_id: 3847247294

        dataset_name: bookcorpus -> artifact_id: 5738291045

        code_name: google-research-bert -> artifact_id: 9182736455
